In this program all properties are displayed with their information. Acts as a small Airbnb application

In addition to this there are features including:
- toggle favourite
- show property on google maps
- statistics (properties viewed etc)
- an option to book that property
- an option to show all booked properties

My challenge task that i have added:
- let users book places and create a window where they can see all of their bookings. Include the number of bookings and cost of all bookings. The places booked should be displayed in a scrollable panel.
